# Hello-world
Just another repository. For get things started practice

Hello there! 
My name is Shuyu Lin. Just started my DPhil @ CS dept. Got stuck by debugging a code for GP exercise, so I realised the importance of version control now. Thus, I'm here learning how to use GitHub. Hopefully this will keep things smooth and easy to organise ^.^
